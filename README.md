# Welcome to Space Deck!

This project dives deep into Space Science with Python
by building an end to end web dashboard containing
simulations, data and scientific theorems and laws
along with their computations!

This project is inspired by and built upon the ideas of
[Astroniz's Space Science With Python](https://www.youtube.com/@Astroniz/)
